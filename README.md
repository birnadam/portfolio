# Reamped Portfolio

## What is this?

This is a portfolio showing viewers a little bit _**about**_ me, the _**projects**_ I've done, and how to _**contact**_ me

## What does this consist of?

This portfolio aeshetics are mostly due to a **Bootstrap** template named *Grayscale*.
<br>I modified the **HTML** and **CSS** to include my information and my pictures.
<br>Through the use of **Javascript** I also altered the subscription form so that it stores the emails.
<br>that viewers input into my **Firebase** database so that I could update people as my portfolio changes.

## What's to come?

- More deployed projects
- Project demos
